    produceDrivingRange() - Returns a function that then calculates whether a given trip is within range. For example, produceDrivingRange(10) returns a function that will return false if the trip is over 10 blocks distance and true if the distance is within range. So produceDrivingRange returns a function that we can then use to calculate if a trip is too large for a driver. We recommend referencing the test/indexTest.js for more details.

    produceTipCalculator() - Returns a function that then calculates a tip. For example, produceTipCalculator(.10) returns a function that calculates ten percent tip on a fare. produceTipCalculator(.20) returns a function that calculates twenty percent tip on a fare.

    createDriver is a function that returns a Driver class. The class has reference to a driverId that is incremented each time a new driver is created. The rest of the code base does not have access to driverId.
